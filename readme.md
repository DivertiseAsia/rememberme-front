This project was initially an in-house coding challenge (June 2019). Later it was expanded and used for a period of time to track time off etc.

This project is **unmaintained**.

refactor/upgrade contains some changes that are untested that allow for compilation.

You must run https://github.com/DivertiseAsia/remember-me-server and it should use firebase for some functionality.
